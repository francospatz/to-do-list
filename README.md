# Welcome to to-do-list üëã

> It is made in React with Tailwindcss and Sass for the styles and Framer-Motion for the animations.

### ‚ú® [Live Demo](https://francospatz.github.io/to-do-list)

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

```sh
npm run start
```

## Known issues
- There is a small bug in the animation of the task cards due to the way of displaying them filtered: the framer-motion layout that allows drag & drop animation does not cope well with the change from display-hidden to display-block.
- The expected result of unchecking a checkbox is that the hover over the unchecked checkbox, which causes a check to appear, is momentarily disabled. It does not work correctly.
- Github Pages has difficulty understanding style preprocessors such as Sass, in particular ‚Äò@apply‚Äô, which allows reusing CSS blocks without having to copy them and without having to modify their selectors. For some reason unknown to me, putting a ‚Äòfoo: bar‚Äô dummy CSS on the next line of each ‚Äò@apply‚Äô fixes this error and we can deploy the application.
